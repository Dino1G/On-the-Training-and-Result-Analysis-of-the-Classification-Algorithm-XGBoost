## Introduction
The paper begins with an exploration of tree methods and boosting techniques. We delve into the mathematical principles of XGBoost, its implementation, and a comparative analysis with the GBDT algorithm. The focus is on understanding the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of these methods in various scenarios.

## Methods
We employ both GBDT and XGBoost methods for our analysis. The paper discusses various aspects of these methods, including their mathematical models, objective functions, optimization processes, and implementation details. We use Kaggle's COVID-19 dataset for training and prediction, focusing on various performance metrics.

## Experiment/Results
Our results indicate differences in performance between GBDT and XGBoost in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and training time. The paper provides a detailed discussion of these findings and their implications.
